# Client

## Overview
The `client` folder contains the frontend code for the web application. This part of the project is responsible for providing the user interface and interacting with the backend server.


## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used in the client-side code.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A React UI framework for implementing Material Design.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A library for efficient state management in React applications.
- **Stripe**: Integrated for payment processing functionality.
- **React Formik**: Utilized for form validation within the application.
- **Unsplash**: Used for accessing high-quality photos.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the client application:

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Modify the `.env` file with necessary environment variables.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server for the client application.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the necessary environment variables are properly configured for the client application to function correctly.
- Make sure to have a working backend server (e.g., Strapi) running concurrently for full functionality.
